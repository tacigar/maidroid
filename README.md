# Maidroid

## Overview

## Usage

First, in order to create a maidroid, you have to craft an empty egg and an egg writer that convert eggs.
Those recipe is as follows.

After you place an egg writer node, and rightclick it, you have to place an empty egg to the slot labeled `Egg`, a coal to the slot labeled `Fuel`, and a dye to the slot labeled `Dye`.
The kind of the dye placed decides a egg produced.
The correspondences are as follows.

|Dye|Egg|
|:--|:--|
|`dye:red`|`maidroid:maidroid_mk1_egg`|

After a while, the empty egg will be converted to an new egg.
If you take and use it, a new maidroid will be born.

The maidroid, however, doesn't move now.
In order to have them move, you have to put a Core that is their brain.
You can create a core in a similar way to a maidroid egg.
First, you have to create an empty core and a core writer.
Those recipe is as follows.

After you place a core writer node, rightclick it, and place a empty core to the slot labeled `Core`, a coal to the slot labeled `Fuel`, and a dye to the slot labeled `Dye`.
The correspondences of dyes and cores are as follows.

|Dye|Core|Description|
|:--|:--|:--|
|`dye:red`|`maidroid_core:basic`|Following the player.|

When a new core is created, put it to the maidroid.
Rightclick it, and put the core to the slot labeled `Core`.
The maidroid will start.
